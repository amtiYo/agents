# AGENTS.md

This file is the project instruction source-of-truth.

## Rules
- Keep changes minimal, testable, and reversible.
- Prefer one source of truth for configuration.
- Do not store secrets in git-tracked files.

## MCP Policy
- MCP registry is stored in `.agents/mcp/registry.json`.
- Local secrets and machine-specific overrides are stored in `.agents/mcp/local.json`.
- Client config files are generated by `agents sync`.

## Workflow
1. Update `.agents/mcp/registry.json`.
2. Optionally update `.agents/mcp/local.json`.
3. Run `agents sync`.
4. Run `agents doctor` if something does not start.
